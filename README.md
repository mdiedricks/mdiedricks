### Hi there, 
I'm a software developer and designer looking at the convergence of technology and our day-to-day lives.

I have a masters degree in architecture, but moved to software development to open up the possibilities of what I could build.

I enjoy learning about Linux, microcontrollers and IoT.

* Current Project: I'm working on an embedded [meditation device](https://github.com/mdiedricks/meditation_device) that detaches you from your mobile phone.
* Currently Learning: backend development through CodeAcademy
* Need help with: If you're open to share some knowledge with me I have some questions about C++ programming
